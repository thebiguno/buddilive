HELP_BUDGET_CATEGORY_NAME=This is the name for a group of common transactions.  For instance, a category named "Groceries" could track food purchases; a category named "Household" to track various household expenses such as furniture and simple home repairs; and a category named "Salary" could track income from a monthly salary.<br/>To group common sets of categories, please refer to the "Parent Category" functionality below.
HELP_BUDGET_CATEGORY_PARENT=A parent category can be used to group related budget categories together.  For instance, assume there is a category named "Automobile Expenses".

Once completed, these three categories would show below the parent category "Automobile Expenses".

HELP_ENCRYPT_DATA_PASSWORD=To ensure data security, you must enter your password to change your encryption preferences
HELP_ENCRYPT_DATA=This option determines whether this account and its sensitive data is encrypted.

HELP_TIMEZONE=The local timezone.  This is used to run scheduled transactions at midnight, local time.  If a given timezone is to support Daylight Savings Time, pick the "Daylight" entry instead of the "Standard" one (e.g. "Mountain Daylight Time" will automatically switch daylight savings time, while "Mountain Standard Time" will not change for daylight savings time).
HELP_USE_TWO_FACTOR=Use two factor authentication.  This allows you to scan a QR code with an authenticator app on your phone (e.g. Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.).  This authenticator app will then generate a 6 digit code every time you log in.<br/><br/>This is an extra factor to reduce the risk of unauthorized parties gaining access to your account, even if they know your password.<br/><br/>Once this checkbox is enabled, you will be prompted to set up two factor authentication.
